# Introduction

The purpose of this Software Testing Strategy is to define a structured approach for ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of the software products. Testing is a critical phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), aimed at detecting defects, verifying that requirements are met, and validating that the application delivers the intended value to end-users.

This strategy establishes the standards, methodologies, tools, and processes that will be applied to both manual and automated testing. It provides guidance to stakeholders—including developers, testers, product owners, and business analysts—on how testing activities will be planned, executed, monitored, and reported.

By implementing this strategy, the team ensures that testing is consistent, measurable, repeatable, and adaptable across different environments, while maintaining alignment with project goals such as time-to-market, cost-efficiency, and high-quality user experience.
