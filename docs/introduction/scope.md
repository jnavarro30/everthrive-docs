# Scope

This testing strategy applies to all components, features, and integrations of the software product under development. It covers multiple types and levels of testing to achieve comprehensive quality assurance. The scope includes:

## Test Levels

Unit Testing – Validation of individual modules or functions.

Integration Testing – Verification of interactions between modules, APIs, or third-party services.

System Testing – End-to-end validation of the application against functional and non-functional requirements.

Acceptance Testing – Ensuring the product meets business and user requirements prior to release.

## Test Types

Functional Testing – Ensuring the application behaves as expected based on requirements.

Regression Testing – Detecting unintended impacts of changes or new features.

Usability Testing – Assessing ease of use and user experience.

Performance Testing – Measuring responsiveness, stability, and scalability under expected and peak loads.

Security Testing – Identifying vulnerabilities and validating data protection.

Compatibility & Cross-Platform Testing – Ensuring consistent behavior across devices, browsers, and operating systems.

## Test Execution Methods

Manual Testing – Exploratory and scenario-based verification.

Automated Testing – Reusable test scripts executed with frameworks like Playwright and Appium for efficiency and wider coverage.

## Exclusions (Out of Scope)

Third-party software not directly integrated into the product.

Hardware-level testing, unless explicitly required.

Non-production infrastructure outside of defined test environments.
